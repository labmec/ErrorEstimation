//// This target focuses on the p-convergence of the flux contribution (NF) to the estimated error;
//// As such, the laplacian equation is evaluated over a single quadrilateral,
//// with homogeneous Neumann BC over 3 sides and a linear Neumann condition over the last side.
//// For a given value of k, the flux index will be evaluated for different enrichment values.
